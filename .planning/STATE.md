### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01 | Manual Next.js setup instead of create-next-app | Existing directory contents prevented create-next-app; moved to old-site-backup/ |
| 01 | Next.js 15.5.12 instead of 14.x | Latest stable version provides better features and performance |
| 01 | React 19 | Latest features and improvements |
| 01 | Framer Motion 12.33.0 | Industry-standard animation library with excellent Next.js 15+ support |
| 01 | Organized folder structure (components/lib/types) | Follows Next.js best practices, prepares for Phase 2 component library |
| 02 | Extended Tailwind colors (not replaced) | Preserves default utilities while adding brand colors |
| 02 | CSS custom properties for brand colors | Enables usage outside Tailwind context |
