# Acer Forestry Website

## What This Is

A modern marketing website for Acer Forestry Ltd, a Scottish woodland establishment specialist operating across the Highlands, Perthshire, and Morayshire. The site serves three distinct audiences: Forest Managers seeking contractors, potential clients exploring services, and self-employed subcontractors looking for work opportunities.

## Core Value

Convert warm leads across all three audiences - Forest Managers into clients, service browsers into inquiries, and quality tree planters into subcontractors - while establishing Acer Forestry as the credible, professional, ethical choice in the Scottish forestry ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] **Services Deep Dive Page** - Detailed showcase of all services (tree planting, manual ground preparation, fertilising, herbicide/pesticide application, tree removal, invasive species control, forest maintenance) with capability to add high-quality photos later.
- [ ] **Subcontractor Funnel Page** - Recruitment page highlighting well-organized sites, weekly payment schedule, competitive rates, caravan accommodation options, good ground conditions, and application process.

- [ ] **Professional Branding** - Refined logo (darker green AF monogram with leaf), cohesive color palette (natural greens, professional neutrals), and typography that blends professionalism with natural warmth.
- [ ] **Smooth Animations** - Framer Motion integration for polished, professional animations and smooth scroll effects that enhance credibility without distracting.

- [ ] **Contact Integration** - Easy access to phone (07756513670) and email (dillan.hill@acerforestry.co.uk) throughout the site.

### Out of Scope

- **Client portal/login system** - No password-protected areas for clients to check project status. Contact remains direct via phone/email.
- **E-commerce/payments** - No online purchasing or payment processing. All contracts negotiated directly.
- **Customer reviews/testimonials** - Not currently available. Design allows for future addition when obtained.
- **Live quote calculator** - Forest management contracts too complex for automated pricing.
- **Multi-language support** - English only for Scottish market.

## Context

### Business Background

- **Company**: Acer Forestry Ltd (SC670730)
- **Directors**: Rob and Dillan (26 years combined experience)
- **Specialty**: Woodland Establishment (planting + 5-year protection until independence)
- **Geography**: Highlands, Perthshire, Morayshire, Scotland
- **Forest Cycle**: 5-year protection period → 35 years growth → timber harvest → repeat

### Scottish Forestry Ecosystem

Forest Managers work for large estates and coordinate multiple specialist contractors:
- Timber Harvesting
- Timber Transport
- Saw Mills
- Fencing
- Deer Culling
- Surveyors
- Ground Preparation
- **Woodland Establishment (Acer Forestry's specialty)**

### Audience Pain Points

**Forest Managers Value:**
1. HSE compliance (health, safety, environment)
2. High tree survival rates
3. Silvicultural understanding (forestry science)
4. Flexibility in project execution
5. Good communication
6. Straightforward invoices matching agreements
7. Ethical values aligned with ICF (Institute of Chartered Foresters)

**Subcontractors Value:**
1. Well-organized work sites
2. Fast payment (weekly in our case)
3. Competitive rates
4. Caravan accommodation if needed
5. Good ground conditions

### Current Website

- Built on Wix platform
- Content scraped and available in `/content.txt`
- Basic structure but lacks modern polish and targeted messaging
- Training videos page exists and should be retained

### Visual Assets

- Logo: AF monogram with leaf (created with Grok AI)
- Needs: Darker green color refinement
- Current scraped site has 7 images (low quality)
- High-quality service photos needed for future enhancement

## Constraints

- **Tech Stack**: React with Next.js, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript — Modern, SEO-friendly, performant
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier acceptable) — Low cost, excellent Next.js integration
- **Performance**: Must work well on slower rural internet connections
- **Mobile First**: Forest managers often access from phones in the field
- **Timeline**: Build it right over build it fast — Quality and professionalism are paramount

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Next.js over plain React | SEO critical for discoverability, Vercel deployment simplicity, excellent Framer Motion support | — Pending |
| Three-funnel architecture | Distinct audiences need tailored messaging (Forest Managers ≠ Subcontractors ≠ Service browsers) | — Pending |
| Design blending professional + natural | Must convey credibility (HSE compliance, ICF ethics) while reflecting connection to Scottish landscape | — Pending |
| Include training videos in v1 | Demonstrates expertise and methods, valuable for both client confidence and subcontractor recruitment | — Pending |
| No reviews/testimonials initially | Not currently available, but design allows future addition when obtained | — Pending |
| Darker green logo refinement | Better connection to forestry/nature theme, more professional than current bright green | — Pending |
