  <files>.planning/phases/10-deployment-testing/testing-checklist.md</files>
  <action>
    Create a detailed testing checklist document covering:

    **Browser Testing Matrix:**
    - Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
    - Mobile: Safari iOS, Chrome Android (latest versions)
    - For each browser, test: rendering, animations, navigation, CTAs

    **Device Testing:**
    - Desktop: 1920x1080, 1366x768 (common resolutions)
    - Tablet: iPad (768x1024), Android tablet (800x1280)

    **Performance Testing (Real Devices):**
    - Run Lighthouse on production URL (all 5 pages)
    - Test slow connection (Chrome DevTools > Slow 3G)
    - Verify Core Web Vitals in production
    - Check Time to Interactive <4s on slow 3G

    **SEO Verification:**
    - Verify all meta tags render correctly

    - Which device/browser
    - Which page
    - What's broken (screenshots help)
    - Any console errors

    The site is now fully tested and verified. You can either:
    1. Announce publicly (social media, update business listings, tell clients)
    2. Keep in soft launch mode (live but not promoted, allowing time for final tweaks)

    Soft launch benefits:
    - Time to monitor for any unexpected issues
    - Can add analytics IDs without rush
    - Can configure custom domain without pressure
    - Early feedback from small audience

    Public announcement benefits:
    - Start getting organic traffic and conversions
    - Forest Managers can find you
    - Subcontractors can discover opportunities
    - Professional online presence established
