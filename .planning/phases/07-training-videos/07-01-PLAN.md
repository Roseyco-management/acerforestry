**Tech stack available:**
- Next.js 15.1.4 with React 19
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Established component library (Section, Container, Card, Heading)

**Established patterns:**
- Hero section with Section background="primary"
- Content sections alternate bg-light/bg-offwhite
- Container size="lg" for content showcase pages
- 16:9 aspect-video ratio for media placeholders
- Responsive grid layouts (1-col mobile, 2-col tablet/desktop)
- Photo placeholder pattern: aspect-video bg-neutral-200 rounded with centered text

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 2: Design system uses natural greens, professional neutrals
- Phase 2: Component variants for consistent styling
- Phase 5: Photo placeholder infrastructure established
- Performance requirement: Must work well on rural Scotland's slower connections

**Performance considerations for rural connectivity:**
- Lazy loading for video embeds (load on user interaction)
- Responsive iframe pattern with aspect ratio preservation
- YouTube/Vimeo lite embeds where possible (thumbnail until play)
- Native HTML5 video with preload="none" if self-hosted

**Video embedding best practices:**
- Use aspect-video (16:9) wrapper for responsive sizing
- Lazy load iframes to reduce initial page load
- Provide fallback text/links if embed fails
- Consider lite-youtube-embed or similar for performance

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build training page hero and layout structure</name>
  <files>src/app/training/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Replace placeholder page with full training videos layout. Create hero section using Section background="primary" with heading "Training Videos" and subtitle explaining educational content demonstrates expertise and methods. Add Metadata for SEO. Below hero, add Section background="light" with Container size="lg". Inside, create responsive grid (1-col mobile, md:2-col desktop) for video cards. Preserve existing route - don't create new files. Use established patterns from services page (Section/Container/Card structure, alternating backgrounds, responsive grid).</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, navigate to /training shows hero and grid layout, responsive on mobile/desktop</verify>
  <done>Training page has hero section, responsive grid layout ready for video embeds, builds without errors</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Provide training video URLs or sources from old Wix site</action>
  <instructions>
    I've created the training page layout structure. To add the actual videos, I need the video sources.

    The old site backup (old-site-backup/videos/) is empty, so videos were likely embedded from YouTube or Vimeo when the site was on Wix.

    Please provide:
    1. YouTube/Vimeo URLs for training videos, OR
    2. Access to old Wix site to extract embed URLs, OR
    3. Confirmation to skip videos for now and add placeholder cards

    Options:
    - If YouTube/Vimeo: Share URLs
    - If Wix site accessible: Share URL so I can extract embeds
    - If videos unavailable: I'll create placeholder cards matching services page pattern
  </instructions>
  <verification>Video URLs provided or placeholder decision confirmed</verification>
  <resume-signal>Provide URLs, Wix site URL, or type "placeholder" to use placeholders for now</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add video embeds or placeholders based on user input</name>
  <files>src/app/training/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Based on checkpoint response, either: (A) If YouTube URLs provided: Add responsive iframe embeds with aspect-video wrapper, loading="lazy" attribute, and lite-youtube-embed pattern (thumbnail + play button overlay to reduce load until clicked). Each video in Card component with optional title/description. (B) If no URLs: Add placeholder cards matching services page pattern (aspect-video bg-neutral-200 "Video coming soon"), with training topics as headings (e.g., "Tree Planting Techniques", "Ground Preparation Methods", "Safety Protocols") and brief descriptions. Use 2-column responsive grid. Avoid custom lite-youtube library unless user specifically requests - use native iframe with loading="lazy" for YouTube/Vimeo which is well-supported and performant.</action>
  <verify>Videos embed responsively OR placeholders display correctly, npm run build succeeds, page loads quickly on throttled connection</verify>
  <done>Training videos display (embeds or placeholders), responsive layout works, no performance degradation, builds successfully</done>
