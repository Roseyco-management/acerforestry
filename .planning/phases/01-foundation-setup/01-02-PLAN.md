<objective>
Add Framer Motion for animations, establish folder structure, and create placeholder pages for all site routes.

Purpose: Set up the scaffolding for organized development with animation capability and route structure ready for content phases.
Output: Folder structure with components/lib/types directories, Framer Motion installed, and placeholder pages for all routes defined in roadmap.

**Required Routes from Roadmap:**

- `/` - Home/Forest Manager Funnel (Phase 4)
- `/services` - Services Deep Dive (Phase 5)
- `/subcontractors` - Subcontractor Funnel (Phase 6)
- `/training` - Training Videos (Phase 7)

**Animation Requirement:** Framer Motion for polished, professional animations and smooth scroll effects (Phase 8 will implement).

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Framer Motion dependency</name>
  <files>package.json</files>
  <action>Run `pnpm add framer-motion` to install Framer Motion library. Verify it appears in dependencies (not devDependencies). Framer Motion is the industry-standard animation library for React with excellent Next.js 14+ App Router support and performance characteristics suitable for rural connectivity.</action>
  <verify>Run `pnpm list framer-motion` shows installed version, package.json includes framer-motion in dependencies</verify>
  <done>framer-motion installed in package.json dependencies</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Set up folder structure for organized development</name>
  <files>src/components/.gitkeep, src/lib/.gitkeep, src/types/.gitkeep</files>
  <action>Create organized folder structure inside src/: `src/components/` for reusable React components (Phase 2 design system), `src/lib/` for utility functions and shared logic, `src/types/` for TypeScript type definitions. Add .gitkeep files to each empty directory to ensure they're tracked by git. This structure follows Next.js best practices and prepares for Phase 2 component library.</action>
  <verify>Directories exist: src/components/, src/lib/, src/types/ with .gitkeep files in each</verify>
  <done>Folder structure created with components, lib, and types directories</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create placeholder pages for all routes</name>
  <files>src/app/services/page.tsx, src/app/subcontractors/page.tsx, src/app/training/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Create placeholder page components for each route beyond home (which exists as src/app/page.tsx). Each placeholder should export a simple component with h1 heading matching the route name and brief description: "Services page coming in Phase 5", "Subcontractors page coming in Phase 6", "Training page coming in Phase 7". Use TypeScript default export function syntax. This establishes routing structure and allows navigation testing in subsequent phases.</action>
  <verify>All route pages exist and are accessible: localhost:3000/services, localhost:3000/subcontractors, localhost:3000/training return 200 with placeholder content (verify with dev server)</verify>
  <done>Placeholder pages created for services, subcontractors, and training routes with descriptive content</done>
</task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `pnpm run dev` starts without errors
- [ ] `pnpm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] framer-motion appears in package.json dependencies
- [ ] src/components/, src/lib/, src/types/ directories exist
- [ ] All routes accessible: /, /services, /subcontractors, /training
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- All verification checks pass
- Framer Motion installed
- Folder structure established (components, lib, types)
- All placeholder pages created and accessible
- No build or TypeScript errors
- Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2 (Design System)
