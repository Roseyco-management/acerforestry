**Tech stack available:** Next.js 15.5.12, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion 12.33.0
**Established patterns:**
- Hero component with title, subtitle, optional CTA
- ValueProp component for benefit sections with alternating backgrounds
- Container size="md" for readable line length in value props
- Phone CTA pattern: anchor wraps Button component for tel: links

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 02: Alternating section backgrounds (bg-light/white pattern)
- Phase 04: Direct phone CTA reduces friction
- Phase 04: Anchor tags wrap Button components for proper clickability
