# Phase 06 Plan 01: Subcontractor Hero & Value Props Summary

**Subcontractor recruitment page launched with hero section and three value propositions addressing key pain points**

## Accomplishments

- Created complete `/subcontractors` page with Hero component featuring "Work With Us" title, compelling subtitle addressing skilled tree planters, and phone CTA (tel:07756513670)
- Added three value proposition sections addressing critical subcontractor priorities: Well-Organized Work Sites, Weekly Payment, and Competitive Rates
- Implemented proper alternating background pattern (bg-light, bg-white, bg-light) consistent with established design system
- Set SEO-optimized metadata with title "Work With Us | Acer Forestry" and description highlighting weekly pay, organized sites, and competitive rates

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/app/subcontractors/page.tsx` - Replaced placeholder with full page structure including metadata, Hero component, and three ValueProp sections following forest-managers page pattern

## Decisions Made

- **Hero subtitle:** Emphasized quality work opportunities, professionalism, weekly pay, and productive work conditions to appeal to skilled subcontractors
- **Value prop ordering:** Placed Well-Organized Sites first to immediately address workflow concerns, followed by Weekly Payment (cash flow priority), then Competitive Rates (compensation)
- **CTA text:** Used "Call About Opportunities" instead of generic "Call Us" to be more specific about the action and outcome
- **Background alternation:** Started with bg-light for first value prop to maintain visual rhythm established in other pages

## Issues Encountered
