# Phase 06 Plan 02: Subcontractor Complete Funnel Summary

**Complete subcontractor recruitment funnel with all five value propositions and dual contact CTAs**

## Accomplishments

- Added two additional value propositions: Accommodation Available and Good Ground Conditions
- Integrated ContactCTA component with phone and email buttons for conversion
- Completed full subcontractor funnel with all five value props addressing core subcontractor priorities from PROJECT.md
- Implemented dark-light-dark visual bookend pattern matching forest-managers page quality

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/app/subcontractors/page.tsx` - Added two value props (Accommodation Available, Good Ground Conditions) and ContactCTA section. Complete page now has Hero + 5 ValueProps + ContactCTA following established pattern.

## Decisions Made

None - followed established patterns from Phase 04 forest-managers implementation. ContactCTA component used as-is with no modifications needed. Background alternation pattern (bg-light/bg-white) maintains visual rhythm.

## Issues Encountered

None - all tasks executed cleanly with successful builds and no TypeScript errors.

## Next Phase Readiness

Phase 6 complete. Subcontractor funnel page fully functional with:
- All five value propositions addressing subcontractor priorities (site organization, weekly pay, competitive rates, accommodation, ground conditions)
- Contact CTAs for conversion (phone + email)
- Consistent responsive design matching forest-managers page quality
- Dark-light-dark visual bookend pattern
- Ready for Phase 7 (Training Videos) or Phase 8 (Animations & Polish)
