**Tech stack available:** Next.js 15.5.12, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
**Established patterns:**
- ContactCTA component for conversion points with phone and email buttons
- ValueProp alternating backgrounds (bg-light/bg-white)
- Dark section bookends (Hero dark → alternating light sections → ContactCTA dark)
- Anchor tags wrap Button components for tel:/mailto: links

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 04: ContactCTA component provides reusable dual-CTA pattern
- Phase 04: Dark background sections create visual bookends
- Phase 04: Dual CTA approach (phone primary, email secondary) for conversion flexibility

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Accommodation and Ground Conditions value props</name>
  <files>src/app/subcontractors/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Add two more ValueProp sections: (1) "Accommodation Available" with description: "Caravan accommodation available for those who need it. We understand traveling for work requires proper accommodation arrangements. Options discussed based on project location and duration." with className="bg-white". (2) "Good Ground Conditions" with description: "We select and prepare sites with care. Quality ground preparation means better planting conditions and more productive days. Silvicultural approach creates better working conditions for planters." with className="bg-light". This brings total to 5 value props covering all subcontractor priorities from PROJECT.md.</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, five value props render with correct alternating backgrounds</verify>
  <done>Five value propositions complete covering all subcontractor priorities: site organization, weekly pay, competitive rates, accommodation, ground conditions</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add ContactCTA section</name>
  <files>src/app/subcontractors/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Import ContactCTA component and add at bottom of page after all ValueProp sections. ContactCTA provides dark background section with phone (07756513670) and email (dillan.hill@acerforestry.co.uk) buttons, creating visual bookend matching Hero dark background. Follows exact pattern from forest-managers page. No props needed - ContactCTA is self-contained.</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, ContactCTA renders with dark background and both contact buttons</verify>
  <done>ContactCTA section added, page follows dark → light alternating → dark bookend pattern, phone and email CTAs functional</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Polish spacing and verify complete funnel</name>
  <files>src/app/subcontractors/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Review complete page structure: Hero (dark) → 5 ValueProps (alternating light/white) → ContactCTA (dark). Verify all sections use consistent spacing (py-16 md:py-24 pattern handled by components). Ensure total of 7 sections (1 hero + 5 value props + 1 CTA). Build and verify no TypeScript errors, responsive layout works correctly. Page should match forest-managers page quality and structure.</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds with no errors, all sections render correctly, responsive on mobile</verify>
  <done>Complete subcontractor funnel page with hero, 5 value props, and contact CTA. All subcontractor priorities addressed. Phase 6 complete.</done>
</task>
