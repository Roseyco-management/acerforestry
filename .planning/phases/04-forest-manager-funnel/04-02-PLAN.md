<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add communication and flexibility sections</name>
  <files>src/app/forest-managers/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Add two more ValueProp sections to forest-managers page. 1) Communication & Flexibility: "Regular updates throughout project lifecycle. Flexible approach adapting to site conditions and project changes. Responsive communication when you need it - phone or email, we're accessible." 2) Transparent Invoicing: "Straightforward invoices matching agreed terms. No surprises, no hidden costs. Clear documentation of work completed with honest, fair pricing." Continue alternating background pattern (white/bg-light).</action>
  <verify>Two new sections render below existing value props with consistent styling and spacing</verify>
  <done>Communication and invoicing trust signals added, addressing Forest Manager priorities 4-6</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add ICF ethics section and create contact CTA section</name>
  <files>src/app/forest-managers/page.tsx, src/components/sections/ContactCTA.tsx</files>
  <action>1) Add ICF Ethics ValueProp section: "Committed to ICF ethical standards in all forestry operations. Professional, ethical approach to woodland establishment that respects environmental stewardship and sustainable forestry practices." 2) Create ContactCTA section component: Container with dark background (bg-charcoal), centered content, Heading "Ready to discuss your project?", subtitle "Get in touch with Dillan to discuss your woodland establishment needs", two Buttons side by side (flex layout, gap-4, flex-wrap for mobile): Phone button (variant="primary", href="tel:07756513670", "Call 07756 513670") and Email button (variant="secondary", href="mailto:dillan.hill@acerforestry.co.uk", "Send Email"). Both buttons should wrap anchor tags around Button components (not inside) for proper clickability.</action>
  <verify>ICF section renders, ContactCTA section displays with two working contact buttons that are clickable and properly styled</verify>
  <done>All seven Forest Manager priorities addressed, prominent dual-CTA contact section created</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add final CTA at page bottom and polish spacing</name>
  <files>src/app/forest-managers/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Add ContactCTA section as final element on forest-managers page after all ValueProp sections. Review entire page spacing - ensure consistent vertical rhythm using py-16 md:py-24 for sections. Ensure page structure is: Hero (dark) → ValueProp alternating backgrounds → ContactCTA (dark) for visual bookends. Add page metadata in page.tsx: title "For Forest Managers | Acer Forestry", description "Professional woodland establishment contractor in Scotland. HSE compliant, high survival rates, 26 years experience. Serving Highlands, Perthshire, Morayshire."</action>
  <verify>Full page flows from hero to final CTA with consistent spacing and rhythm, metadata shows in browser tab</verify>
  <done>Complete Forest Manager conversion page with all value propositions, trust signals, and multiple contact opportunities</done>
