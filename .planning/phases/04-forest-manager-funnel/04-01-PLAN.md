**Tech stack available:** Next.js 15.5.12, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion 12.33.0

**Established patterns:**
- Component library in `src/components/ui/` and `src/components/sections/`
- Tailwind color system with primary (dark green), secondary (rust), accent (gold), offwhite, light (light gray), charcoal
- Semantic heading decoupling (Heading component with as/size props)
- Container with responsive sizing (sm/md/lg/full)
- Button variants (primary/secondary/outline)
- clsx for className merging via cn() utility

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 02: Three-folder component structure (ui/, sections/, layout/)
- Phase 02: Variant-based styling over duplication
- Phase 02: Semantic vs visual heading decoupling for SEO
- Phase 03: MainLayout wrapper provides Header/Footer automatically

**Key messaging (from PROJECT.md):**
Forest Managers value:
1. HSE compliance (health, safety, environment)
2. High tree survival rates
3. Silvicultural understanding (forestry science)
4. Flexibility in project execution
5. Good communication
6. Straightforward invoices matching agreements
7. Ethical values aligned with ICF (Institute of Chartered Foresters)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Forest Manager page with hero section</name>
  <files>src/app/forest-managers/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Create new page at `/forest-managers` route. Import Hero component and create compelling hero section targeting Forest Managers. Title should address them directly ("For Forest Managers" or "Professional Woodland Establishment"). Subtitle should highlight credibility: HSE compliance, 26 years combined experience, ICF ethical standards. CTA should be phone contact (tel:07756513670) or "Get in Touch". Use established Hero component pattern from sections/Hero.tsx.</action>
  <verify>npm run dev and visit http://localhost:3000/forest-managers - hero section displays with dark green background, light text, and working CTA</verify>
  <done>Hero section renders correctly with Forest Manager-focused messaging and functional phone CTA</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create HSE Compliance value proposition section</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/ValueProp.tsx, src/app/forest-managers/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Create reusable ValueProp section component in sections/ directory. Props: icon (ReactNode optional), title (string), description (string), className (optional). Layout: Container with centered content, Heading for title, paragraph for description, optional icon at top. Use this pattern to add HSE Compliance section below hero on Forest Manager page. Message: "We prioritize safety as non-negotiable. Stringent HSE measures guarantee well-being of team members and stakeholders. All sites managed with safety-first approach aligned with industry standards." Use Tailwind bg-light for subtle background distinction.</action>
  <verify>Section renders below hero with proper spacing, readable text, and responsive layout on mobile/desktop</verify>
  <done>ValueProp component created and HSE section displays with clear messaging and professional styling</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add tree survival rates and silvicultural expertise sections</name>
  <files>src/app/forest-managers/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Add two more ValueProp sections to forest-managers page. 1) Tree Survival Rates: "High tree survival rates from proper planting technique and 5-year protection protocols. Every tree planted with silvicultural precision to ensure establishment success and long-term forest health." 2) Silvicultural Expertise: "26 years combined forestry experience with deep understanding of tree species selection, site conditions, and Scottish woodland establishment. We understand the science behind successful forests." Alternate background colors (white/bg-light) for visual rhythm. Ensure responsive spacing (py-16 md:py-24 pattern).</action>
  <verify>Both sections render with alternating backgrounds, proper spacing, and mobile-responsive layout</verify>
  <done>Three core value propositions (HSE, survival rates, expertise) displayed in clean, scannable format addressing Forest Manager priorities</done>
</task>
