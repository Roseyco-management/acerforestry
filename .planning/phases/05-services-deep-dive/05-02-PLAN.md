**From 05-01:** Hero section and first 4 service cards (tree planting, ground prep, fertilising, herbicide/pesticide) in 2-column responsive grid

**Tech stack available:** Next.js 15.5.12, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Card component with hover effects
**Established patterns:**
- Alternating Section backgrounds for visual rhythm
- 2-column responsive grids (1 column mobile)
- Card components with consistent padding and hover effects
- Container size="lg" for grid layouts

**Constraining decisions:**
- Cards use bg-offwhite, not white (from design system)
- Photo placeholders should be subtle, not distracting
- Mobile-first responsive approach

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add final three service cards</name>
  <files>src/app/services/page.tsx</files>
  <action>After existing 4-card grid section, create new Section with bg-white (alternating from previous bg-light). Inside Container size="lg", build another responsive grid (grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6) containing 3 Card components:

1. **Tree Removal** - "Safe, professional tree removal when required for site management or forest health. Experienced team handling removals of all sizes with attention to site impact and safety protocols."

2. **Invasive Species Control** - "Strategic control of invasive plant species threatening native forest establishment. Evidence-based approaches protecting young trees and promoting healthy woodland ecosystems across Scottish landscapes."

3. **Forest Maintenance** - "Comprehensive forest maintenance throughout the critical 5-year establishment period. Regular monitoring, weed control, and protection measures ensuring your investment reaches independence and long-term success."

Each Card structure matches first 4: Heading (as="h2" size="lg") + description paragraph. Grid uses 3 columns on desktop (since only 3 cards), 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile.</action>
  <verify>Visit /services, scroll to see all 7 service cards across 2 sections, responsive behavior correct, alternating backgrounds present</verify>
  <done>All 7 services displayed with professional descriptions, responsive grids working correctly, visual rhythm established</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add photo placeholder infrastructure</name>
  <files>src/app/services/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Inside each Card (all 7 cards), add a photo placeholder div BEFORE the Heading. Structure: `<div className="aspect-video bg-neutral-200 rounded mb-4 flex items-center justify-center text-neutral-400 text-sm">Photo coming soon</div>`. This creates:
- 16:9 aspect ratio container
- Subtle gray background (not distracting)
- Rounded corners matching card aesthetic
- Centered placeholder text
- Ready for Next.js Image component replacement in future

Add comment above first Card: `{/* Photo placeholders ready for high-quality service images - replace bg divs with Next.js Image components when available */}`. Do NOT import or configure Next.js Image yet - just prepare the structure.</action>
  <verify>All 7 cards now show subtle gray placeholder boxes above headings, "Photo coming soon" text visible, aspect ratio maintained, no layout breaks</verify>
  <done>Photo placeholder infrastructure in place for all services, ready for future image integration without structural changes</done>
</task>
