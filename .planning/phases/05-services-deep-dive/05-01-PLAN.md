**Tech stack available:** Next.js 15.5.12, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion 12.33.0, clsx
**Established patterns:**
- Hero component for page intros
- Card component with bg-offwhite, rounded, shadow, hover effects
- Container size="md" for focused content
- Alternating Section backgrounds (bg-light/white)
- Semantic heading decoupling (as prop vs size prop)
- Metadata for SEO optimization

**Constraining decisions:**
- Card hover effects with transition-shadow
- Three-column responsive grids that stack on mobile
- Mobile-first approach for field accessibility

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Services page hero and structure</name>
  <files>src/app/services/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Replace placeholder page with production structure. Add Metadata export with title "Our Services | Acer Forestry" and description listing all 7 services for SEO. Build Hero component with title "Our Services", subtitle describing 26 years experience across all woodland establishment and maintenance services. Use Container + Section structure. No CTA in hero (this is informational, not conversion-focused like Forest Manager page).</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, page renders at /services with hero section, no TypeScript errors</verify>
  <done>Hero section displays with proper title, subtitle, and page metadata configured</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add first four service cards</name>
  <files>src/app/services/page.tsx</files>
  <action>After hero, create Section with bg-light. Inside Container size="lg", build responsive grid (grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6) containing 4 Card components:

1. **Tree Planting** - "Professional tree planting using silvicultural best practices. Every tree planted with precision to ensure establishment success and long-term forest health. 26 years experience across diverse Scottish terrain and species."

2. **Manual Ground Preparation** - "Expert manual ground preparation optimizing site conditions for planting. Careful terrain assessment and preparation techniques that respect site ecology while ensuring optimal tree establishment."

3. **Fertilising** - "Targeted fertilising programs supporting young tree growth and forest health. Application methods adapted to site conditions and species requirements, promoting strong early growth and long-term vitality."

4. **Herbicide/Pesticide Application** - "Professional herbicide and pesticide application protecting young forests from competition and pests. All applications follow stringent HSE protocols with certified operators ensuring environmental compliance and forest protection."

Each Card should contain: Heading (as="h2" size="lg") with service name, paragraph with description. Keep cards visually consistent. Grid adapts: 1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet+.</action>
  <verify>Visit /services, confirm 4 service cards display in responsive 2-column grid, cards stack on mobile, all descriptions readable</verify>
  <done>Services page shows hero + 4 service cards with professional descriptions in responsive grid layout</done>
