Purpose: Enhance perceived professionalism and credibility through smooth, purposeful animations that guide user attention without distraction.
Output: Animated hero sections on all pages, staggered navigation animations, reusable animation wrapper components.

# Discovery findings
**Framer Motion + Next.js 15 App Router patterns:**
- `"use client"` directive required for all animated components
- Use `initial` and `animate` props for entrance animations
- Use variants pattern for coordinated animations
- Use `transition` with duration/ease for timing control
- Avoid AnimatePresence for page transitions (App Router complexity)

**Animation principles for professional forestry site:**
- Subtle and purposeful (not flashy)
- Duration: 0.5-0.8s for entrance (professional pace)
- Ease: "easeOut" for natural deceleration
- Stagger delays: 0.1-0.15s between elements
- Fade + slight upward motion (dignified, lifting effect)

**Tech stack available:**
- Framer Motion 12.33.0 installed
- Next.js 15 App Router (Server Components by default)
- TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create reusable animation wrapper components</name>
  <files>src/components/animations/FadeIn.tsx, src/components/animations/SlideUp.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create two client-side animation wrapper components using Framer Motion:

**FadeIn.tsx:**
- "use client" directive at top
- Wraps children in motion.div
- Props: delay (default 0), duration (default 0.6)
- Animation: opacity 0→1, ease "easeOut"
- Forward className prop to motion.div for styling flexibility

**SlideUp.tsx:**
- "use client" directive at top
- Wraps children in motion.div
- Props: delay (default 0), duration (default 0.6)
- Animation: opacity 0→1, y: 20→0, ease "easeOut"
- Forward className prop to motion.div

Both components should:
- Use TypeScript with proper prop types (ReactNode children, number delay/duration, string className)
- Have clean, minimal implementation (no variants needed for single animation)
- Export as default

Avoid: Complex variants (overkill for simple fade/slide), AnimatePresence (not needed for entrance), whileInView (that's Plan 02).
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds without TypeScript errors, components render without console warnings</verify>
  <done>FadeIn and SlideUp components created with proper "use client", TypeScript types, and Framer Motion props. Build successful.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add entrance animations to Hero sections across all pages</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/Hero.tsx</files>
  <action>
Convert Hero component to client component and add entrance animations:

1. Add "use client" directive at top of Hero.tsx
2. Import motion from "framer-motion"
3. Wrap title (Heading) in motion.div with opacity 0→1, y: -10→0, duration: 0.6s
4. Wrap subtitle (p tag) in motion.div with opacity 0→1, y: 10→0, duration: 0.6s, delay: 0.15s
5. Wrap CTA button (Link) in motion.div with opacity 0→1, scale: 0.95→1, duration: 0.5s, delay: 0.3s

**Implementation notes:**
- Use inline motion.div animations (no separate components needed - Hero already imports motion)
- Animations: title enters from above (y: -10), subtitle from below (y: 10), button scales in
- Stagger timing: title→subtitle (0.15s delay)→button (0.3s delay)
- All use ease: "easeOut" for natural deceleration
- Do NOT wrap the entire section - animate children individually for stagger effect

**Why not use FadeIn/SlideUp wrappers:** Hero has specific stagger timing and directional movements (title up, subtitle down, button scale) that benefit from inline customization.

Avoid: Wrapping entire Hero in one animation (loses stagger), using whileInView (entrance on page load, not scroll), complex variants (inline props are clearer here).
  </action>
  <verify>Visit http://localhost:3000/forest-managers and refresh - hero title, subtitle, and button should animate in with staggered timing (title first, then subtitle, then button). No layout shift.</verify>
  <done>Hero component converted to client component with staggered entrance animations. Title animates from above, subtitle from below, button scales in. Timing feels professional and purposeful.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add staggered entrance animation to navigation links</name>
  <files>src/components/layout/Header.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add subtle staggered fade-in animations to Header navigation links:

1. Add "use client" directive at top of Header.tsx
2. Import motion from "framer-motion"
3. Identify the navigation links in desktop nav (likely in a nav element)
4. Wrap each Link in motion.div with:
   - initial: { opacity: 0, y: -5 }
   - animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }
   - transition: { duration: 0.4, delay: 0.1 * index, ease: "easeOut" }

**Stagger pattern:** First link no delay, second link 0.1s, third link 0.2s, etc.

**Implementation approach:**
- Map over links array if structured that way, or manually add motion.div to each Link
- Use inline delays (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3s) for each link in order
- Keep animations subtle (small y: -5 movement, not dramatic)
- Phone CTA button can have delay: 0.4s to animate last

**Mobile menu consideration:** Mobile menu opens on click (useState toggle), so animations there would be jarring. Only animate desktop nav links. If mobile menu exists, skip animating those (they should appear instantly when menu opens).

Avoid: Animating logo (should appear immediately), animating mobile menu links (instant on click is better UX), large movements (too distracting for header).
  </action>
  <verify>Visit http://localhost:3000 and refresh - desktop navigation links should fade in from top with subtle stagger (left to right). No layout shift in header.</verify>
  <done>Header navigation links animate in with subtle stagger on page load. Professional, understated effect that doesn't distract from content.</done>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] npm run build succeeds without errors or warnings
- [ ] npm run dev starts successfully
- [ ] Visit all pages (/, /forest-managers, /services, /subcontractors, /training) - hero animations work consistently
- [ ] Navigation links stagger in smoothly without layout shift
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in animated components
- [ ] No console warnings about client/server component boundaries
